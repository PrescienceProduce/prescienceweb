What Is Prescience Produce?</strong><br><strong>1/29/2019<br></strong><br>I'm Produce Pat. &nbsp;Many people literally call me that. &nbsp;<br>Prescience Produce LLC is my company. <br><br>I started Prescience Produce because I wanted to own a business. That's the easiest way to say it anyway. &nbsp;What I really wanted was an R&amp;D department for growing produce. &nbsp;It turns out to justify have an R&amp;D department, you have to have a company that does things that warrant researching and developing first. &nbsp;That's why we're here.&nbsp;<br><br>If you're wondering about the name, straightforwardly, it's a <em>Dune</em> reference. &nbsp;Frank Herbert's <em>Dune</em> is my favorite series of novels. &nbsp;They're great and if you haven't read them, you should. &nbsp;<em>Dune</em> doesn't have so much to do with produce, but it does have a lot to do with ecology. &nbsp;This emphasis on ecology really resonates with me and that mindset influences the things I choose to grow and how I choose to grow them. &nbsp; <br><em><br>Dune </em>also involves a lot of looking forward into the future, a trait the novels call "prescience." &nbsp;While I won't claim to grow or even know of any "spice" that does that, I do spend a lot of time envisioning the future of food. &nbsp;I am not sure the future looks as bland and sterile as its popular depiction. &nbsp;Given environmental stability and time, natural systems tend towards complexity. It's not unreasonable to envision the people of the future eating fruits and vegetables we've not yet heard of.&nbsp;<br><br>My goal is to seek those foods out and work on turning them into viable crops and productive ecological systems. &nbsp;To accomplish this research, exploration, selective breeding will be necessary. &nbsp;Prescience Produce is the vine on which the fruit of this labor will grow.&nbsp;</div>
